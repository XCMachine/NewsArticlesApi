This is the first small project that represents the news articles into an explorable app that not only has small description, but the option to open the link of external websites that has more information about a particular article.
It shows a list of the title of the article made by TechCrunch and taking only the top headlines of the articles.

Everything was made with Flutter Framework and all the ownership was made by me.
The API is from this website: https://newsapi.org/
